## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved working with a new company that wanted a way for people to schedule driving lessons online. They needed a system that would handle signing up and scheduling, feedback from instructors, and making payments.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job understanding what the client needed and outlining these needs clearly in the business requirements document. I think my design document was also strong and created the structure to make sure the system could handle lots of users and keep data safe.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change one thing about my work I'd tweak the UML documents. I'd like to make the interactions and steps clearer and make sure the documents are following all industry standards better.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting what users needed is important. I made user stories and used the interview document to make sure the design really matched what users needed. Making sure the design fits with user needs is important because a system has to meet those needs to be successful.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
As a web developer, this was my first time using UML sequence and use case diagrams. They've been helpful for organizing and visualizing the project details. The diagrams helped me break down complex things into more understandable parts that help make the whole design process easier to manage. For any future projects I work on that involve system design, I plan to continue using UML to help outline the system architecture early on. This will help the usability and functionality of the systems I develop and make sure it is user-friendly and manageable from the start.
